​​Statement of Ambition and Life Purpose

This required personal statement focuses on the scout’s history in scouting, his family, his influences and his passions. It should end with a statement about what the future holds.

When crafting your statement of ambitions and life purpose, I’d encourage you to write about any goals you have, currently. There’s a high chance that your plans might change, so this is something you’ll likely enjoy looking back on in the future!
One way to approach this statement is to outline your academic, professional, and personal goals you plan to accomplish within the next five years. Here are a few example questions to consider when writing your Eagle Scout personal statement:
One academic goal of mine is to take a full schedule of classes next year (I didn't this year) including a Computer Science class, and be able to get, let's say, an average of an A- or higher in those classes.
Another academic goal is to assist the Head-Royce robotics team in programming our robots.
Do you have plans of going to college? What do you hope to do there?
I plan to go to college. I hope to study Computer Science there.
What are some skills or talents you have that could lead to a career?
I have skills at programming which could lead me to a career. I am also interested in botany, which, if I studied it more, could also lead me to a career.
Do you have any personal interests or hobbies that you hope to continue to work on?
I want to continue to work on various programs that I have been creating, I want to continue mountain biking, and I want to breed my own orchids and grow them until they flower and beyond
What is your vision for your ideal life? How would you positively impact others?
I would positively impact other
Answering these types of questions will give you a fuller picture of your life’s vision for the future! I’d also recommend including how you plan to incorporate the Scout Oath, Law, Motto, and Slogan while working towards your goals.
Boy Scout Motto
Be Prepared!

Boy Scout Slogan
Do a Good Turn Daily!

Your introductory paragraph should go over some of the most impactful experiences you’ve had in Scouting thus far, as well as what you’ve learned from those experiences. Some experiences you can highlight are times when you acted as a leader, times where you learned an important value, or even things that you learned in Scouting that you’ve applied to a situation outside of Scouting.
The important part here is to consider what you’ve learned from your Scouting career (Hopefully, a lot). The Eagle Rank is the highest rank in Scouting, and with it comes a wealth of experiences and wisdom that you’ve had to learn along the way. Here is how I chose to tie in what I learned from Scouting:

Your introduction shouldn’t be long-winded, as you’ll have many other parts of your essay to get into more detail. Keeping it brief and to the point will likely be the most effective approach to completing your introduction. When writing your intro, here are a few questions you could ask yourself:
Introductory Questions to Consider
What part of the Scout Oath and Law means the most to you? How have you lived by it in your Scouting and non-Scouting life?
What is a specific Scouting experience you’ve had where you’ve learned something of great value? What did you learn? How did you end up learning it?
How have you most changed from when you were a new scout? Think back to who you were, as a person, when just entering Scouting.
When you hear the word “Scouting,” what comes to mind? Why?
Short-Term Goals for High School
The focus of your next section should be the goals you’d like to complete before finishing high school. These short-term goals can be academic (like getting all A’s), extracurricular (Like making varsity), or even personally-related (such as a hobby, interest, or side-business).
This section can also be used to describe how to plan to achieve these goals. Success comes from making solid plans and then executing on them, so make sure you think about how to achieve your goals. This way they won’t just be dreams! Here’s how I wrote about my high school goals:

Introduction
Some of the most impactful experiences I have had in Scouting were being an Assistant Patrol Leader, a Patrol Leader, going to Wente (the scout summer camp), and completing my Eagle project. Being an APL taught me how to take on responsibility when not given credit for it: my Patrol Leader was more often than not absent at meetings and outings, so I had to step up often. Being a Patrol Leader taught me almost the opposite, ironically: how to delegate work to patrol members. Going to Wente was where I learned to sail and to mountain bike, which I highly enjoy and will do for the rest of my life. Executing my Eagle Project taught me so many things. One was getting comfortable socially networking. Spreading awareness and communicating with donors was key to the success of my project, which involved collecting, repairing, and donating used bikes to those in need. Another thing it taught me was simply how to repair bikes.
The aspect of the Scout Oath and Law that means the most to me is "help other people at all times" and "A Scout is...Helpful". That informed my work as APL for two years and Patrol Leader for 1.5, and informed the work of my Eagle project, where the whole point was to help people in need and help an organization (EBAC) that helped those in need.

Short-Term Goals for High School
One academic goal of mine is to take a full schedule of classes next year (I didn't this year) including a Computer Science class, and be able to get, let's say, an average of an A- or higher in those classes.
Another academic goal is to assist the Head-Royce robotics team in programming our robots. I plan to go to college; I hope to study Computer Science there. I have skills in all of the academic subjects, which could lead me to any career, but I highly enjoy programming/coding/creating digital interfaces like apps and websites. I prefer and am right now more skilled at developing the functional rather than aesthetic aspects of a human-computer interface. I am also interested in botany, which, if I studied it more, could also lead me to a career. As for hobbies, I want to continue developing useful or at least intriguing software regardless of whether I have a job in the field, and I want to continue mountain biking for the rest of my life. I want to do a 100 mile bike ride soon; perhaps I could do it this summer. I also imagine that some fun trips would be biking down Mount Diablo, biking through the Marin Headlands, and bikepacking to Point Reyes if possible.

Long-Term Goals For After Graduation
I believe that after I graduate High School I will attend a 4-year college, where I hope to study Computer Science. One of the colleges that seems most desirable to me right now is Harvey Mudd. Others are Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Pitzer, and possibly some other schools strong in Computer Science outside of California, although I prefer the climate of California and dislike long, cold winters. One aspect of Cal Poly SLO that improves its appeal is that not only is it strong in Computer Science, it is also strong in plant sciences, which I might discover I like more than Computer Science. This is in contrast to Harvey Mudd, which is strongly focused only on the STEM fields, which makes it so that one is more stuck with their choice - although Harvey Mudd is also connected to the other 4 Claremont Colleges, which makes it not so STEM-isolated.
I love taking care of plants, but I feel like it would be better as a hobby with software development as a job than vice versa. I think I will most likely get a job developing software, but if I study plants instead in college, I might like a job in the mass production of baby plants, but their seems to me that I would not like the low-paying jobs of doing what machines can't (too repetitive), and the high-paying jobs would be highly technical, mostly involving high science applied to breeding the best possible plants - which would not be hands on, and would take the joy out of horticulture for me. This just reaffirms for me that I would prefer horticulture as a hobby, but then again, I might decide otherwise in college. Perhaps I may open a nursery on the side, towards the end or after my career.
I want to go to a 4-year college so that I can get a job developing software. That's why I am focusing on schools strong in Computer Science. I have heard that people can get into software development jobs through shorter, more intensive coding/development training, but I just don't trust the sound of that as much as the well-known colleges I am considering. Another reason I choose a 4-year college over intensive coding training is that I want to learn Computer Science, not just coding. I am already decent at coding. I feel that learning the theories and principles in Computer Science, and the knowledge underlying coding tactics, and the knowledge of computers at the most basic level, could make me a better software developer, and give me a better shot at positions above "coder", which feels like it has a connotation of someone who does a brainless task, taking instructions from those with the inspiration to imagine new software - that's who I want to be. Of course, I don't deride coders, being one myself, and I would be happy to be both an originator of an idea and one who implements it.

Life Purpose and Values
I suppose I would like a family of my own. I would like to get a living space of my own as soon as possible; I prefer solitude. I would start with an apartment, then eventually a nice house (but eventually ideally means soon). I would like to have much light let into the living space (be it apartment or house) although that's a big ask for an apartment. This is partly because I just like natural light, and partly because I would like to propagate orchids in my living space. If I could not get enough natural light (very likely in an apartment) I would use artificial grow lights for my plants. Somehow, I would like to keep alive all of my grandma's (hundreds of) cymbidium orchids after she dies, because they are beautiful, valuable, and are heirlooms from her father, my great-grandfather. In my free time, I would most like to care for and propagate plants, and bicycle. The closest thing to a bucket list experience for me is that I would like to bike down as many long hills as possible, and another is if I could actually breed my own orchids and grow their offspring from seed to flower. This is trivial with other plants, but a full-on laboratory challenge for orchids.
I learned from Scouting the value of expanding one's horizons, and the value of helping others. I suppose these would be the theme of the goals for my life. I learned to expand my horizons through the various Merit Badges offered. For example, I earned every watercraft Merit Badge and the Triplet of Fishing, Flyfishing, and F&W Management (breadth across one field), but also the two firearm badges, and Pioneering (breadth across all fields). Applying this principle to my life outside of scouting, I took Computer Science in 10th grade and fell in love, and starting now I am attempting to learn Robotics. I would not have learned the fun of fishing, nor the wonders of software development, without expanding my horizons. With this in mind, I will consider colleges that give me a wide range of majors, even though I believe I currently want to major in Computer Science.
As for the value of helping others be happier and freer from suffering, I grew in this aspect during my Eagle Project. One thing I mused over was that I must not be charitable to make myself feel good, but to truly help the beneficiaries. During my Eagle Project, I became somewhat proficient at repairing bicycles. At several colleges I have visited, the school runs a free bike-repair service, staffed by students, for the benefit of students. If I go to a school that has this program, I will work or volunteer in such a service. Other ways I could apply this value of helping others could be to run a community garden, and to teach Computer Science to Middle or High-Schoolers once I am done with my main career. If Scouting stays the same or improves, I think it would be beneficial for my own children, because of, as I experienced, the way Scouting opens one's eyes to so many different, diverging pursuits, yet provides a guide in the form of the Oath and Law.

Your Life’s Purpose and Values
The final section of your Statement of Ambitions and Life Purpose should be used to describe your ultimate life’s vision. What do you really want out of life? Good topics to consider for this section could include plans about a future family, community involvement, and bucket-list experiences.
One thing you should try to mention in this section is how you plan to use the lessons you’ve learned from Scouting when you’re older. You don’t have to promise to return to Scouting in the future (although if you do see yourself volunteering, be sure to mention it), but you should try to discuss how you’ll use what you’ve learned to better the world.
Here is how I chose to describe my life’s purpose and values:
If you’re having trouble figuring out how to write this last section, keep in mind that your goals are only half of the question. Consider what values you feel are most important to you as well. What brings purpose and meaning to your life? There’s no right or wrong answer here, so feel free to expand on these points as much as you’d like!
You can honestly take any direction you’d like when writing about your life’s purpose, but I’d recommend asking yourself the following questions to first gain some clarity:
Life Purpose Questions to Consider
Think about when you’ll be 30-40 years old. What do you picture your life will be like at that age? What will you have accomplished? What part of doing that will make you happy?
How will you stay involved with your family when you’re older? Do you have plans on eventually having a family of your own?
What would you most like to do in your free time? Do you plan to travel, volunteer, or maybe even do something else?
How will you stay involved in your community when you’re older? How close do you want to be with others in your community? Do you want to be a mentor?
If you could assign yourself a life ‘theme,’ what would it be? Some ideas include creativity, integrity, resourcefulness, or anything else you can come up with. How will you embody this theme in your life purpose?
Conclusion
Although the ideas you’ll cover in your Statement of Ambitions and Life Purpose will likely change as you get older, I really encourage you to be as detailed as possible when writing your essay. Believe me, when you’re older you’ll look back on this essay and appreciate the glimpse it gives you into your life right now!
Your Statement of Ambitions and Life Purpose is essentially a time capsule of your teenage self, so it’s vital to do it right. By using the structure we covered in this article, and asking yourself important questions about how you want your life to look, I’m sure you’ll create an awesome essay!
Chances are this won’t be the last essay you write. In fact, your Statement of Ambitions and Life Purpose may just be the start of an awesome college application essay! To make your college goals a reality, check out my complete guide to Writing An Eagle Scout College Essay That Gets You Accepted.
Congrats on making it to the end of this article, as well as for your upcoming Eagle Rank! Hope to see you back at ScoutSmarts again soon and, until next time, be the best individual you can be!



While I highly encourage you to talk about your extracurricular or personal goals as well, I’d highly recommend that you mention your high school academics in some way when writing this section.
Even if you don’t have plans to continue your education after high school, the main point of this part of your life is likely to become educated and graduate with your high school diploma. As such, a portion of this section should be dedicated to discussing your academics (it could even be one sentence stating that you plan on finishing high school!).
Short-term Questions to Consider
Are there any classes you want to take before you graduate, such as any AP or IB classes? Why do you want to take these classes? How do you think they could help in your future?
Do you have any goals you want to complete in your extracurricular activities? How can you take on more leadership in your teams, clubs, and community service groups?
Are there any personal interests you’ve developed while in high school that might steer you towards a certain career? Consider things you’re good at, love doing, and might make you money.
Long-Term Goals For After Graduation
This section focuses on your long-term plans after graduating from high school. There are many avenues you could pursue after your graduation! Will you be going to a trade school? The military? Continuing your education by attending a four-year university or a community college? Heading straight to the workforce? The possibilities are endless!
I’d recommend considering how you want your life after high school to look (especially since it’ll be happening eventually). Think not just about continued education, but also the values and jobs you’ll be taking on. Here’s how I discussed my own plans in this section of my Statement of Ambitions and Life Purpose:
This section gives you a lot of freedom to express yourself; you can go into as much detail as you’d like when explaining your post-graduate plans. For example, if you’re sure that you want to enter a trade school, feel free to talk about the steps you’re going to take in order to get trained, certified, and hired for the trade of choice!
Since you’ll be earning your Eagle Rank soon, it’s vital that you learn how to Properly List Eagle Scout On Your Resume. Not only does this improve your odds of landing a job and getting into a good school, it’ll also help you to more effectively describe your Scouting experiences (and learn from them, too)!
Here’s a Tip: Be realistic, but also dream big! Since in this section you can talk about your desired career, feel free to set a big, hairy, audacious goal (I call this a BHAG). Setting a huge, motivating goal for your future can spur you into action and help you to accomplish anything!
With your BHAG in mind, here are a few questions to consider that can point you in the right direction when writing this section:
Long-term Questions to Consider
If you’re planning on entering the workforce, what type of job are you looking for? What steps might you take to increase your chances of being hired for the position you’re interested in?
If you’re planning on joining the military, what branch of the military are you interested in joining? Why do you want to join this section of the military?
If you’re planning on going to trade school, what type of trade interests you? Do you know any schools that excel in teaching this trade? Do you want to start your own business with this trade or join an existing company?
If you’re planning on continuing your education, will you be going to a community college or a four-year university? What do you want to get out of your continued education, and how will you make it happen?
If none of these options apply to you, what will you be doing? Do you have plans to do one of the previous options eventually or are you planning on sticking to your original plans for a long time?
In a perfect world, where do you see yourself in 5 years? What do you want to (and
