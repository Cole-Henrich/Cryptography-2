                        non-english ciphertext or French. It does this by checking whether a certain proportion (as

                        English
                        words.
                        I created
                        this list by Scanning and retrieving the unique words out of a compendium of:

                        1. Part of Chapter 3 of "When the Emperor was Divine" by Julie Otsuka

                        4. A Portion of "Dreams From my Father" by Barack Obama, at least the preface, introduction,
                        and
                        the first chapter.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While I compiled this list using Scanner and its associates, I as of this writing have the
                        lists
                        compiled in 3
                        separate static arrays (static in terms of access and in terms of their mutability), which
                        are
                        split
                        into 3 to
                        avoid overflowing the 64 kb. limit on Java classes.
                        These are then accessible through a BiggestArray Class which can return an array of the
                        (however
                        many, if I scan
                        more books) arrays.
                        <br>
                        Update: I am, as of this second writing of the proposal, working on a class which will
                        compile
                        these array-storing classes when run (i.e., when there are new sources of text), so that the
                        text-input goes straight into the static arrays. I consider it a "dormant compiler", because
                        it
                        compiles other classes, and then goes dormant (not modifying anything) until a new text
                        source
                        is input and it is called to run. This way, it strikes a compromise between Scanner
                        recreating
                        the list every runtime (bad) and the static arrays needing to be manually updated when the
                        trainer-text is updated (bad), and the result is good.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I intentionally
                        created the static (non-mutable) arrays to speed up processing times.

                        for those who want to play around; I created (not in connection with
                        this project) a set of substitution encrypters and decrypters (which need the key, far different
                        from the cipher
                        cracker I'm making here); the set includes (as of this writing) substitution using emojis,
                        substitution using
                        permutations of the characters &lt; and &gt; which results in a cipher looking like a snake;
                        various variations
                        on this previous one, such as with permutations of commas and periods - graphically minimalist.
                        <br>
                        The set also includes a substitution cipher using most sample of the keys on the qwerty keyboard,
                        in general
                        substituting alphabetic characters for alphabetic characters, but also including nonalphabetic
                        characters out of
                        the necessity to find encrypted equivalents for non-alphabetic characters like ! and ?.

                        Will be able to take at least a key for sample alphabetic characters, I may
                        extend that to more or even as many chars as they want. It can then encrypt and decrypt using
                        their key.

                                I say this word because it is different from AutoCrack. AutoCrack, for any cipher here,
                                means
                                (or
                                the

                                cracking a cipher solely given the enciphered text. Machine-Decrypt is when the user

                                they just want the computer to blaze through their text and translate each letter. I

                                because the functionality in use is not any of the cryptography theory generally in use

                                again, what is a Vigenère key like?, which informs how the program will process a given
                                key.

                                Whereas the Caesar and Substitution ciphers will have paltry graphics, the Vigenère,
                                having
                                more
                                parts,
                                may
                                include more <b>graphics</b>, which may interest the user more and get them to think
                                about the
                                inner
                                workings

                                the
                                cryptographical theory that is deciphering their input.
                                The same goes for the Enigma Machine.

                                I intend to create a interactive representation of the enigma machine, so that the user
                                can play with the "gears" and alter its function "mechanically". I expect to give it as
                                many interactive parts as it needs to create a real enigma cipher; if there are any
                                non-essential parts (there may not be), I will not include those in the digital
                                simulation for the sake of time. I hope to create both an enigma-maker and an
                                enigma-cracker; if I have to choose between one in the case of a time crunch, I think I
                                might choose the enigma-maker, since you can only create an enigma with an enigma
                                machine, but maybe you can crack it another way. Still, I intend to do both if I can.
                                There is a nice enigma machine on <a href="https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine"
                                    style="color: black;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptii.com</a>, but
                                I intend to make mine a little more like a "machine", with at least a few graphical
                                representations - e.g., an image of a gear that you can turn, maybe.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect that there will be some functionality missing from the enigma
                        machine in terms
                        of
                        simulating
                        sample of
                        its
                        mechanical parts; I may not be able to send the private key for RSA through the program
                        (users
                        may
                        have
                        to
                        rely
                        on just texting or emailing, but maybe, in some long shot, I might give it that
                        ability).
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also
                        know
                        that
                        in
                        the current version of my substitution cipher, there is this flaw: it starts cracking
                        the cipher
                        by
                        assuming
                        that the first four letter word, which starts and ends with the same letters, that it
                        encounters, is
                        the
                        enciphered equivalent of the word "that".
                        This is most often correct, since "that" is one of the most common four letter words,
                        hence it
                        is
                        most
                        likely to
                        occur before the others, and as long as it comes first (in this algorithm) it's ok. What
                        matters
                        most,
                        though,
                        is "that" is by far the most common 4 letter word which starts and ends with the same
                        letter. For
                        example,
                        if
                        I
                        see the text "qreq" very frequently throughout a substitution cipher, qreq most likely
                        equals
                        "that",
                        and
                        hence
                        I can add q = t, r = h, e = a to the key I am compiling. This is exactly what the
                        algorithm
                        does.
                        Having
                        assumed
                        h, a, and t, it moves on the other inferences using those assumptions. I won't go in
                        depth here.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
                        after
                        sample
                        that pretext, here (finally) is the flaw: what if qreq is <i>not</i> "that"? Answer: the
                        cipher
                        <b>will
                            not</b>
                        be cracked. Not with this algorithm, on that piece of text.
                        As long as I can, I will methodically minimize the chances of such mistakes occuring.
                        However,
                        they
                        will
                        never
                        be completely eradicated, as long as I am using algorithms which run by assuming the
                        identity of
                        words
                        based
                        on
                        the composition of their letters.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the RSA functionality will not be able to use prime numbers as
                        long as are in
                        use for
                        actually
                        encrypting people's data.
